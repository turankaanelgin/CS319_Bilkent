It is straightforward to play and enjoyable. In the game, there is a ball sequence 
moving in a maze, which is composed of different colors of balls and players'
purpose is to destroy the sequence by making combinations of balls with same colors. 
For this purpose, they control a shooter which throws the balls from the middle of the 
screen. If they are not able to destroy the sequence on time, it will go through a hole 
and they lose. Every successful trial helps players to finish the level faster and 
their scores will be recorded according to the times they finish the level. 
Sometimes a coin appears in the corner of the screen and it is a gift for players 
for purchasing some special items from the store of the game. The aim
is to play all levels successfully and complete them as much as fast.
